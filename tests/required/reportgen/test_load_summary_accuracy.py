"""Pins the reported load-side values to hand-computable known inputs.

`test_lifecycle_report_shape.py` already reaches `load_summary`, but it only asserts
shape: that `schedule_delay` carries mean/min/median/max and that `achieved_rate > 0`.
Both are exactly computable from the fixture it builds. This module supplies request
lifecycle metrics with explicitly chosen scheduled and actual send times and asserts the
reported numbers equal the values those times imply.

Every expected value below is written as a literal or as a one-step arithmetic
expression over the injected times. Nothing here recomputes an expectation by calling
the code under test, so a change in `summarize_requests` cannot move the oracle with it.

Oracle: the injected `scheduled_time` and `start_time` values in each test.
Faked: only the lifecycle metric objects. `summarize_requests` itself is the real one.
