"""Regression tests for bounded stage teardown.

A stage that times out with work still in flight must never hang the run:
in-flight requests get the configured grace to finish, whatever remains is
cancelled, and a worker whose event loop is wedged (never observes the
cancellation) is terminated and respawned so later stages still run.

Timing assertions are two-sided on purpose. The lower bound pins that the
grace was actually waited for; the upper bound pins that teardown returned as
soon as the work was done instead of exhausting the grace, force, or reap
windows. Deterministic components per stage (with the default constants and
the per-test grace G): ~2s of stage run (1s scheduling offset + 1s stage
timeout), then G of wind-down when tasks are still pending, then sub-second
cancellation/rendezvous overhead.
