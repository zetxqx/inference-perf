# Comparing Results Across Benchmarking Tools

Two benchmarking tools pointed at the same server with their default settings do not produce
comparable numbers. The differences are in the workload each tool generates, in what each one
counts, and in what each one excludes from the measurement window, and they move headline
throughput and latency by tens of percent before the server is involved at all. In practice a
cross-tool gap is a configuration difference until proven otherwise.

This page lists what has to agree for a comparison to mean anything, and how to check that it
did. It is the user-facing half of the parity work in #481, which encodes the same rules as
runnable workload definitions.

## What has to agree

| Dimension | Why it moves the numbers |
| :--- | :---
| Output length | Sets decode work per request, so it drives output throughput, TPOT and total tokens |
| Input length | Sets prefill work, and can push prompts across a server-side batching or context boundary |
| `ignore_eos` | Without it the model stops when it stops, and output length is a property of the model rather than of the config |
| Sampling parameters | Greedy and sampled decoding are different work, and tools differ on what they send by default |
| Load model | A fixed-concurrency (closed loop) run and a fixed-rate (open loop) run measure different things |
| Warmup | Compile, cache and autoscale effects land inside the window unless excluded |
| Token counting | Client re-tokenization and server usage disagree, and tools differ in which they report |
| Server configuration | Same server build, same flags, same model, or the comparison is of two servers |

## Output length

Pin it on both sides: a fixed output length plus `ignore_eos`, so every request generates
exactly the requested number of tokens.

In inference-perf, set `server.ignore_eos: true` and a fixed output distribution:

```yaml
server:
  ignore_eos: true
data:
  output_distribution:
    type: fixed
    mean: 1024        # every request asks for exactly this many tokens
    total_count: 1000
```

`type: fixed` emits `mean` for every request. The default is `type: normal` with a nonzero
`std_dev`, so a config that does not say otherwise is sending a distribution, not a length.

## Input length and the range-ratio footgun

`vllm bench serve` controls input length with `--random-range-ratio`, and **the meaning of that
flag was inverted upstream**, so the same value produces opposite workloads depending on the
version under test:

| vLLM version | Default (`0.0`) produces | Fixed lengths need |
| :--- | :--- | :---
| Before v0.8.4 (vllm-project/vllm#16126) | `Uniform[0, len]`, a mean of roughly half the requested length | `--random-range-ratio 1.0` |
| v0.8.4 and later | Fixed lengths | `--random-range-ratio 0.0` (the default) |

Running the older behavior against an inference-perf run with fixed lengths compares a workload
of about half the tokens against the full one. This was the root cause of a reported cross-tool
throughput gap, and it is the fixture the parity harness in #481 is built around. Version
strings printed by a serving container describe the engine, not the vendored benchmark script,
so check the behavior rather than the version when a container is involved.

The same care applies to inference-perf's `data.input_distribution`: pin it with `type: fixed`
when the goal is comparability rather than a realistic mix.

## Warmup and the measurement window

inference-perf has no dedicated warmup phase; every request it sends is measured. Tools that
exclude a warmup set are therefore reporting a different window on the same server, and the
difference is largest exactly where warmup matters most: first-token latency tails on backends
that compile or populate caches on first use.

Until a first-class warmup stage exists, approximate it with a short first stage in
`load.stages` and compare later stages only, or hold the server warm before the run and say so
alongside the numbers.

## Load model

`load.type: constant` or `poisson` offers requests at a rate, independent of how fast the
server answers. `load.type: concurrent` keeps a fixed number of requests in flight, so
throughput is a function of latency by construction. A closed-loop run and an open-loop run are
not comparable at any rate, and neither is a comparison where one tool caps per-worker
concurrency below the other's offered load.

## Which side counted the tokens

Tools differ in whether reported output tokens are the server's own count or the client's
re-tokenization of the response, and the two disagree. See
[Token Accounting and Provenance](./metrics.md#token-accounting-and-provenance) for what each
inference-perf field is derived from. For a cross-tool comparison, prefer the server-reported
count on both sides, and set `report.request_lifecycle.use_server_output_tokens: true` so the
per-token latency metrics are normalized by it.

## Server configuration

Hold the server identical: same build, same model and quantization, same
`--max-model-len`, same batching and cache flags. Note that input length interacts with this:
prompts that are longer on one side, including the tokenizer and chat-template overhead the
client does not model, can cross a chunked-prefill or context boundary and change the server's
batching, which shows up as a client-side latency difference that no client caused.

## Flag and setting map

**Checked on 2026-08-21 against `vllm bench serve` from vLLM v0.10.0 and `aiperf profile` from
AIPerf v0.12.0.** Both tools have changed what these flags mean between releases, so
treat a row as unverified against any other version and re-read the tool's own `--help` before
relying on it. The version of vLLM the parity harness (#481) pins is the one these rows were
read from.

| What you are pinning | inference-perf | `vllm bench serve` v0.10.0 | `aiperf profile` v0.12.0 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| Evenly spaced arrivals at a rate | `load.type: constant`, `stages[].rate` | `--request-rate` with `--burstiness` above 1 (approximate) | `--request-rate` with `--arrival-pattern constant` |
| Poisson arrivals at a rate | `load.type: poisson`, `stages[].rate` | `--request-rate` (default `--burstiness 1.0`) | `--request-rate` (default `--arrival-pattern poisson`) |
| Fixed requests in flight | `load.type: concurrent`, `stages[].concurrency_level` | `--max-concurrency` | `--concurrency` |
| How much load to send | `stages[].duration`, or `num_requests` under `concurrent` | `--num-prompts` | `--request-count`, or `--benchmark-duration` |
| Input length | `data.input_distribution` (`type: fixed`, `mean`) | `--random-input-len` with `--random-range-ratio 0` | `--isl` with `--isl-stddev 0` |
| Output length | `data.output_distribution` (`type: fixed`, `mean`) | `--random-output-len` with `--random-range-ratio 0` | `--osl` with `--osl-stddev 0` |
| Generate to the length cap | `server.ignore_eos: true` | `--ignore-eos` | `--extra-inputs ignore_eos:true` |
| Streaming | `api.streaming` | fixed by the endpoint, no flag | `--streaming` |
| Tokenizer | `tokenizer.pretrained_model_name_or_path` | `--tokenizer` | `--tokenizer` |
| Reproducible prompts | `data.seed` | `--seed` (default `0`) | `--random-seed` |
| Excluded warmup | no equivalent | no equivalent | `--warmup-request-count`, `--warmup-duration` |
| Sampling parameters | no equivalent for synthetic data | `--temperature`, `--top-p`, `--top-k`, `--min-p` | `--extra-inputs temperature:0` and similar |

### Where the map breaks

These are the rows that cannot be translated by substituting a value, and they are the reason
a converted config still needs reading:

- **Arrival spacing defaults disagree.** Both peers default to Poisson at a given rate
  (`--burstiness 1.0`, `--arrival-pattern poisson`), so "rate 40" on either side is not the
  evenly spaced stimulus `load.type: constant` produces. Set the pattern explicitly on both
  sides or compare only average offered rate. vLLM has no exactly even setting: burstiness
  above 1 draws intervals from a gamma distribution that only approaches even spacing.
- **vLLM sends everything at once unless you ask otherwise.** `--request-rate` defaults to
  `inf`, which also disables `--burstiness`, so the default run offers all `--num-prompts`
  immediately. The nearest inference-perf equivalent is `load.type: concurrent` with
  `concurrency_level` set to the request count, not any rate.
- **Count against duration.** `--num-prompts` and `--request-count` are counts; a `constant`
  inference-perf stage is a rate for a duration, so the count is `rate * duration` and only
  matches when the rate is actually achieved.
- **`--random-input-len` is not the prompt length.** vLLM subtracts the tokenizer's special
  tokens first (`real_input_len = input_len - num_special_tokens_to_add()`), so a
  BOS-prepending tokenizer sends one token fewer than requested. Expect a small fixed offset
  rather than an exact match on input tokens.
- **One range ratio covers both directions.** `--random-range-ratio` widens input and output
  together, while inference-perf configures each distribution separately. At v0.10.0 the range
  is `[len * (1 - r), len * (1 + r)]` and the tool asserts `r < 1.0`, so the pre-v0.8.4
  fixed-length recipe of `1.0` now fails loudly instead of silently producing a different
  workload.
- **Nobody's defaults agree.** inference-perf distributions default to `type: normal` with a
  nonzero `std_dev`, AIPerf's `--isl-stddev` and `--osl-stddev` default to `0` (fixed) with
  `--isl` defaulting to 550, and vLLM's range ratio defaults to `0` (fixed) at this version.
  A comparison of two default configs compares three different workloads.
- **Only AIPerf can exclude a warmup.** Its warmup requests are sent and dropped; inference-perf
  measures everything it sends. See the warmup section above for the workaround.
- **Sampling parameters are not configurable here** for synthetic workloads, so runs take the
  server's defaults while both peers can pin greedy decoding. Pin the peer to whatever the
  server defaults to, and say which that was.

### Converting a run automatically

There is no converter today, and the rows above are the mapping in the meantime. One is tracked
in #755, outside this release. The parity harness in #481 carries worked examples of the
mapping, a `vllm bench` argument file and the inference-perf config that matches it, kept in
sync by a test; a converter would be built and tested on those pairs, and would have to refuse
or annotate every break listed above rather than translate silently.

## Verify before comparing

1. Compare the total tokens each tool sent and received, not just the rates. For fixed lengths,
   totals should equal requests times length on both sides; a total that lands near half the
   expected value is the range-ratio case above.
2. Compare the input and output length statistics each tool prints. Equal means and unequal
   minima and maxima still means non-comparable workloads.
3. Check `token_count_mismatches` and `client_fallback_requests` in the inference-perf report. A
   nonzero value means its own counts are mixed-source, which has to be resolved before
   attributing a delta to the other tool.
4. Only after those agree, compare throughput and latency, and report the configuration of both
   runs alongside the numbers.
