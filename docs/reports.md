# Inference Perf Reports

`inference-perf` generates detailed reports in JSON format after a benchmark run. These reports help you analyze the performance in depth.

## Report Files

By default, reports are saved in a directory named `reports-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`. The following files are typically generated:

- **`summary_lifecycle_metrics.json`**: Aggregated metrics for the entire benchmark run.
- **`stage_N_lifecycle_metrics.json`**: Metrics for a specific load stage (where N is the stage index).
- **`per_request_lifecycle_metrics.json`**: Raw data for every single request, including timestamps and token counts.
- **`config.yaml`**: A copy of the configuration used for the run.

## Understanding the Report Structure

Here is an example snippet from a `summary_lifecycle_metrics.json` report:

```json
{
  "successes": {
    "count": 480,
    "latency": {
      "request_latency": {
        "mean": 3.31,
        "median": 2.11,
        "p90": 5.94
      },
      "time_to_first_token": {
        "mean": 0.80,
        "median": 0.20,
        "p90": 2.26
      }
    },
    "throughput": {
      "requests_per_sec": 1.02,
      "total_tokens_per_sec": 676.12
    }
  },
  "failures": {
    "count": 3,
    "request_latency": {
      "mean": 9.948665728999458,
      "min": 0.5831485409980814,
      "p90": 11.684405915999378
    },
    "prompt_tokens": {
      "total": 0.0,
      "cached": 0.0,
      "uncached": 0.0,
      "mean": 0.0,
      "min": 0.0,
      "p90": 0.0,
    },
    "by_label": {
      "504 - Gateway Timeout": {
        "count": 2,
        "messages": [
          {
            "message": "...504 Gateway Time-out...",
            "session_ids": [
              "trace1715_066de3655406_a9687407",
              "trace2210_1f9b0c4d7e21_b3c58120"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      "400 - Invalid JSON": {
        "count": 1,
        "messages": [
          {
            "message": "...Invalid JSON: EOF while parsing a string at line 202 column 31...",
            "session_ids": [
              "trace42_9f000393d262_f395c930"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*(Note: Actual reports contain more percentiles and metrics).*

### Key Sections

- **`load_summary`**: Details about the requested vs achieved load.
- **`successes`**: Metrics for successful requests.
- **`failures`**: Metrics for failed requests, including the per-label error breakdown.
- **`goodput_metrics`**: (Optional) Goodput statistics if constraints were configured.

### Token Counts

`successes` carries both a client-side and a server-side token count, and they are not
interchangeable: `output_len` is the client's re-tokenization of the response text,
`output_tokens` is the server's own count, `prompt_tokens` is the server's count of the prompt
with client tokenization as the fallback, and `token_count_mismatches` counts the requests
where the two output counts disagree. Alongside it, `client_fallback_requests` says how many
requests had no server number at all, per side. See
[Token Accounting and Provenance](./metrics.md#token-accounting-and-provenance) for what each
field is derived from and which one normalizes per-token latency.

## Session Reports

Session replay runs (for example OTel trace replay) additionally produce session
lifecycle reports, where a session is a graph of dependent requests. Alongside
`num_sessions_succeeded` and `num_sessions_failed`, the summary carries a
`failures` section with the same shape as the request-level one:

```json
{
  "num_sessions": 100,
  "num_sessions_succeeded": 94,
  "num_sessions_failed": 6,
  "failures": {
    "count": 6,
    "by_label": {
      "predecessor_failed": {
        "count": 4,
        "messages": [
          {
            "message": "predecessor failed",
            "session_ids": ["trace1715_066de3655406", "trace2210_1f9b0c4d7e21"]
          }
        ]
      },
      "recorded_fallback_malformed": {
        "count": 2,
        "messages": [
          {
            "message": "recorded fallback for evt_7 is also malformed",
            "session_ids": ["trace42_9f000393d262"]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Unlike request failures, which are bucketed by parsing server error text, session
failures are bucketed on a stable cause code emitted by the replay runtime. The
prose in `messages` may embed per-event ids, so the code is what keeps a cause
from splitting into one bucket per failure.

| Cause code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `predecessor_failed` | An event this one awaited failed, so the request was skipped. |
| `predecessor_wait_failed` | Waiting on a predecessor event timed out. |
| `session_already_failed` | The session was already failed when this event was reached. |
| `recorded_fallback_malformed` | `bad_tool_call_handling=use_recorded` fired, but the recorded fallback message was also malformed. |
| `substitution_tool_call_expected` | The recorded trace expected a tool call at this slot but the live model returned plain text. |
| `request_failed` | The request to the model server raised; `message` carries the exception type and text. |
| `unknown` | The session failed without a more specific cause being recorded. |
| `unreported` | The session was counted as failed but carried no error at all. Should not occur; treat as a bug. |
