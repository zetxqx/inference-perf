# Inference Performance Metrics Definition

This document outlines the key metrics used for evaluating performance, their definition and how they are calculated.

## Throughput

| Metric | Formula | Unit | Used For
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| **Output tokens / second** | `total output tokens / time in seconds` | tokens / second | Calculating output token throughput of the inference server
| **Input tokens / second** | `total input tokens / time in seconds` | tokens / second | Calculating input token throughput of the inference server
| **Requests / second** | `total requests completed / time in seconds` | qps | Calculating request throughput of the inference server

## Latency

| Metric | Formula | Unit | Used For
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| **Time per request (e2e request latency)** | `request completion time - request send time` | seconds per request | Calculating how long a request takes to complete
| **Time to first token (TTFT)** | `time first non empty output token received - request send time` | ms | Calculating the time it takes for the user to receive the first token from the response
| **Time per output token (TPOT)** | `(e2e request latency - ttft ) / (output tokens - 1)` | ms per output token | Calculating the average time it takes for the user to receive successive tokens after the first token
| **Normalized time per output token** | `e2e request latency / output tokens` | ms per output token | Normalizing the request latency at the output token level for comparing different use cases
| **Inter Token Latency (ITL)** | `time between output token generation within a request` | ms per output token | Calculating the time it takes for the user to receive successive tokens after the first token, but at a more granular level than TPOT which averages the token latency within a request

## Price/Performance

| Metric | Formula | Unit | Used For
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| **$ per million output tokens*** | `((accelerator $ / second) / (output tokens / second)) * 1M` | $ | Calculating the cost to serve million output tokens
| **$ per million input tokens*** | `((accelerator $ / second) / (input tokens / second)) * 1M` | $ | Calculating the cost to serve million input tokens
| **Throughput / $** | `(output tokens / second) / (accelerator $ / second)` | million output tokens | Calculating the performance to price ratio to get the throughput we are able to achieve for the cost spent

*\*Note: input and output token cost might need to be divided in mixed-batching cases since they are handled together by the server, using some factor like 1:4 for cost to generate input vs output tokens.*

## Token Accounting and Provenance

Every token count in a report comes from one of two places. The **server** reports `usage` on
the response; the **client** tokenizes the prompt it sent and the text it received. The two
disagree in practice, because of tokenizer revision differences, chat-template and tool-schema
overhead the client does not model, and streamed text re-encoded in fragments. The report
therefore keeps both and records which is which.

| Field | Source | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :---
| `prompt_tokens` | server `usage.prompt_tokens`, client tokenization when the server reports none | Resolved per request while the response is processed. Supersedes `prompt_len`. |
| `prompt_tokens.cached` / `.uncached` | server `usage.prompt_tokens_details` | Absent when the server does not report the detail |
| `output_len` | client | The response text re-tokenized as one whole message |
| `output_tokens` | server `usage.completion_tokens` / `usage.output_tokens`, client `output_len` when the server reports none | Server-side this is an exact count of decode steps |
| `client_fallback_requests` | n/a | Per side (`prompt`, `output`), how many successful requests carry a client count because the server reported none. Counts requests, not tokens. Nonzero means that distribution mixes sources |
| `token_count_mismatches` | n/a | Streamed requests where the sum of the per-chunk client tokenization differs from the server count |

Usage keys differ by API: OpenAI-compatible servers report `prompt_tokens` and
`completion_tokens`, the Anthropic Messages API reports `input_tokens` and `output_tokens`.
Both are read.

### Which count normalizes per-token latency

TPOT, normalized TPOT, output token throughput and token goodput divide by the client-side
`output_len` by default. Setting `report.request_lifecycle.use_server_output_tokens: true`
switches them to the server count for every request where the server reported one. It resolves
that count from the same usage keys the report does, so either spelling switches the metrics.
The flag does not change `output_len` or `output_tokens` themselves, only which of the two the
per-token metrics divide by.

### Reading a mismatch

A nonzero `token_count_mismatches` means client and server disagree on how many tokens the
response contained, so any metric normalized by the client count is off by that much. A
nonzero `client_fallback_requests` entry means the opposite problem: for those requests there is no
server number to compare against, and `output_tokens` is carrying the client count. Both are
worth checking before comparing runs, and before comparing against another tool.

The CLI summary's Token Length Aggregates table labels each column with its source and reports
any fallbacks in the table caption.

## Session-Based KV Cache Hit Rate

| Metric | Formula | Unit | Used For
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| **kv_cache_hit_percent** | `100 × (total cached prompt tokens / total prompt tokens)` | percent (0–100) | Token-weighted cache hit rate across all sessions
| **kv_cache_hit_per_session_percent** | distribution of `100 × (session cached tokens / session prompt tokens)` | percent (0–100) | Per-session cache hit rate distribution (min/mean/max/percentiles)

Both metrics use the server-reported `prompt_tokens` as the denominator and `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` as the numerator. Sessions where the server does not report cache information are excluded (reported as `None`, not 0%).

**Server requirement:** vLLM must be started with `--enable-prompt-tokens-details` for the server to populate `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` in the usage response.

**Note:** vLLM's `cached_tokens` is block-granular — the reported value is quantized by the KV cache block size, so the hit rate may not reflect exact token-level precision.
