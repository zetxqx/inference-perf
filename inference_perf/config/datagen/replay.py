    """How to handle a tool-call response whose `function.arguments` is not
    valid JSON.

    Some server-side tool-call parsers (e.g. vLLM's `qwen3_xml`) leak parser
    markers into the `arguments` JSON string at decode time. vLLM still
    returns 200 on the response, but on the *next* turn the chat template's
    `json.loads(arguments)` raises and vLLM returns HTTP 400. Replaying the
    bad bytes verbatim therefore halts the session.

    none
        Default. No mitigation. Bytes propagate; vLLM may HTTP-400 on the
        next turn. Use for benchmarking the upstream bug or for strict
        trace fidelity.

    use_recorded
        When the live model returns malformed `arguments` for a tool_call,
        discard the live response and substitute the recorded assistant
        message at this slot. The recorded `tool_call_id` flows naturally
        into the recorded role:tool successor that follows. The next-turn
        request is structurally identical to a healthy replay: same
        message count, same roles, valid JSON in arguments, matching
        tool_call_id pairs. The next-turn live model never sees its own
        malformed output.

        If the recorded message ALSO has malformed tool_calls (the trace
        was captured from a buggy parser too), the current event is
        hard-failed via _fail_and_notify(); EventFailedError cascades to
        downstream events that await this one's output. Parallel DAG
        branches continue.
