    Streams real image+prompt pairs from the public
    ``lmarena-ai/VisionArena-Chat`` HuggingFace dataset. The dataset stores
    images undecoded (raw encoded bytes), so each request attaches them as
    pre-encoded image blocks without a re-encode round trip, and uses the first
    user turn of the row's conversation as the prompt text.

    The loader streams up to ``num_rows`` usable rows into an in-memory pool at
    startup (bounding memory, since the images are the heavy part) and cycles
    deterministically through that pool on the hot request path. The dataset is
    public, so no HuggingFace token is required.
