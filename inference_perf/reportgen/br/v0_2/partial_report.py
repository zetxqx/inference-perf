"""Emit inference-perf's slice of a BR0.2 benchmark report.

Inference-perf only speaks to the sections of a BR0.2 report it can fill
truthfully from a run: the schema ``version``, the ``run`` block (a generated
``uid``, an ``eid`` shared by every stage of the invocation, and the
wall-clock ``time`` window of the stage), and the ``results`` block built
from the actual request metrics. Everything else (stack, scenario,
observability beyond what we measure, user/cid/pid/description) is left
absent so a downstream composer can merge another producer's partial
on top with ``yq '. * load("other.yaml")'`` and have no inference-perf field
silently overwrite the composer's data.

Convention: emitted maps omit ``None`` values entirely (``exclude_none=True``)
so a deep-merge never overwrites a real value with ``null``. Datetimes are
serialized as ISO-8601 strings (``mode="json"``); the document is otherwise
plain YAML with no anchors, tags, or aliases.

    Returns a plain dict, ready to be serialized as YAML and dropped alongside
    the other report files. ``None``-valued fields are stripped so the file
    yq-merges cleanly with partials from other producers.

    ``run_eid`` is the invocation-wide experiment id: pass the same value for
    every stage of a run so a composer can group the per-stage partials as one
    experiment without parsing uids or filenames. When ``None`` the field is
    omitted, not emitted as null. Like ``run.uid``, a composer is free to
    overwrite it during merge.

    ``stage_start``/``stage_end`` are the stage's wall-clock (epoch) window
    from ``StageRuntimeInfo``. They are the only usable time source here: the
    request lifecycle timestamps are monotonic-clock values with an arbitrary
    origin, so deriving ``run.time`` from them lands in January 1970. When the
    window is not supplied, ``run.time`` is omitted rather than fabricated.

    Pass the same ``use_server_output_tokens`` as the native lifecycle
    reports so both reports of the run agree on token counts.
