"""Validation of the emitted BR0.2 partial reports.

Four contracts are enforced per ``inference-perf.partial.stage_<n>.yaml``:

1. **Schema**: the partial must validate as a ``BenchmarkReportV021`` document
   on its own (required fields populated, optional sections absent).
2. **Mergeability**: no ``None`` values anywhere — a downstream composer's
   deep-merge must never see an inference-perf ``null`` clobber real data.
3. **Agreement**: the BR aggregate and the native per-stage lifecycle report
   are two projections of the same request metrics through two code paths
   (``br/v0_2/adapter.py`` vs ``reportgen/base.py``). Any disagreement is
   #564-family drift: one of the paths changed and the other did not.
4. **Self-consistency**: ``run.time.duration`` must match the window its own
   ``start`` and ``end`` describe. It is deliberately not checked against the
   lifecycle report's ``benchmark_time_seconds``, which measures a different
   window; see :meth:`BrPartialValidator._check_run_time`.
