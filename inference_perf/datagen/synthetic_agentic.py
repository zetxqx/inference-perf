"""Synthetic multi-agent session generator.

This module builds synthetic agent-session replay graphs procedurally.
Determinism is a hard requirement: graph generation must be a pure function
of (config, session_index), reproducible byte-for-byte across processes
(e.g. a parent process and its worker processes). To achieve this we avoid
Python's salted `hash()` entirely and derive all randomness from `numpy`
`Generator` instances seeded from stable, path-derived integers.

#
# Free-text turns (e.g. an agent's objective/summary line) are padded with filler
# so the turn's token count matches a sampled target, while keeping the "real"
# content the model should attend to distinguishable from the padding. The padding
# is wrapped in a <context>...</context> block that bounds it on both sides and
# frames it as supplementary background; the real content is emitted LAST, after the
# block (the highest-attention recency slot). The framing is soft ("supplementary
# background, focus on the task below") rather than "ignore this filler", because a
# theme's filler is domain-relevant (log lines / metric rows), so calling it
# garbage-to-ignore would read oddly; steering the model to the task keeps the
# padding non-load-bearing without claiming plausible content is noise. The framing
# lives INSIDE the block so it stays self-contained if this content is later
# re-injected into a growing transcript.

# doesn't blow past its target; it lives here as part of the same token-budgeting

    corpus keeps themes without `filler_templates` working unchanged.

    Duplicate placeholders in one template resolve to the SAME value (one
    sub-seed per DISTINCT field name), keeping rendered docs internally
    consistent.

    After all fields are drawn, a paired-field pass enforces `in_use{N} <=
    max{N}` (same trailing index) wherever both co-occur in the template, so a
    pool line never reads an implausible `in_use 900/500`.

    `pinned` (optional) maps an entity category name (or `entity`) to a fixed
    value; when a field resolves to that category the pinned value overrides the
    per-field draw. Only entity/typed-entity fields honor pinning; numeric/time
    fields are unaffected. This is how one round pins a shared primary subject.

    `path` is the seed sub-path prefix under which per-field sub-seeds are
    derived (appending a stable per-field index), so different fields draw from
    independent streams and different renders never collide.

        Each event is exactly one LLM call whose INPUT is the cumulative conversation
        transcript ending in a user or tool message; the assistant reply that call
        produces is the event's OUTPUT (expected_output), not a separate lone-assistant
        event. The agent is a linear accumulating chain:

            principal -> t0 -> t1 -> ... -> t{k-1}(terminal)   [k tool results]

        where the principal outputs the first tool call, each ':tN' event's
        input re-injects the prior event's tool-call reply (output segment) plus
        that call's result (unique segment), and the LAST event's OUTPUT is the
        plain answer. With k=0 the principal itself is terminal (its output IS
        the answer) — a bare single-round agent is EXACTLY one event. Fan-out
        replaces the terminal with a merge event whose output is the answer.

        The FIRST call of every agent carries the byte-identical invariant
        system head (a per-event copy). Returns None if the agent's minimum cost
        (one terminal call) does not fit the remaining event budget.

        `reserved` carries the events this agent's ANCESTORS have committed to but
        not yet emitted (see `_fits`); it is threaded through every budget test here
        and passed down to any sub-agents this agent spawns.
