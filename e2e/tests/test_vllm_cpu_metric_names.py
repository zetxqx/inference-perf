"""Declared vLLM Prometheus metric names exist on the servers we gate on (#669).

A stale metric name never errors: the PromQL query matches nothing and the
report field comes back empty (#382 hand-caught exactly such a rename, #698
tracks five more). A pinned release's metric names never change, so for pins
the live server is only needed to prove the committed snapshot is honest;
``latest`` floats with upstream, so only a live server can vouch for it.
That splits the invariant into three checks, each in the cheapest tier that
can catch its failure mode:

1. ``test_declared_names_resolve_against_goldens`` (serverless, runs in the
   gating sim invocation): every name the client declares resolves against
   every committed per-release golden. Catches stale declarations, and
   catches changes to the declaration API itself, on the PR that makes them.
2. ``test_exposed_families_match_golden`` (live, pinned releases): the
   running server's ``vllm:*`` families equal the release's golden exactly,
   keeping the goldens honest. Skips when no golden exists for the running
   release, which is the deliberate state of ``latest``: a floating tag
   would guarantee golden rot, so it never gets one.
3. ``test_declared_metric_names_exist`` (live, every release in the table):
   declared names present in the real exposition, the end-invariant itself.
   On ``latest`` this is the early warning that an upstream rename is
   coming, red on live PRs before, not at, the next pin bump.

Which release the live server runs is not observable from the server itself
(``/version`` reports the app version, not the image tag), so CI exports
``E2E_VLLM_VERSION`` per slice; without it the golden check has nothing to
compare against and skips. Set ``E2E_UPDATE_METRIC_GOLDENS=1`` to rewrite
the running release's golden in place instead of asserting (then commit the
diff); capture and check share one code path, so a golden is by construction
what the check would have accepted.
