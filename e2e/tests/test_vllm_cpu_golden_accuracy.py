"""Live golden accuracy against a real vLLM server in CPU mode (#627).

The sim goldens (#631) control ground truth but share none of a real
server's tokenization; this test uses the real server itself as the oracle.
Every request is sent with ``ignore_eos``, so the server must generate
exactly the request's token budget, and:

- server-reported ``usage.completion_tokens`` == the budget, per request,
  zero tolerance (proves the run is deterministic in length)
- client-derived ``output_len`` == server ``completion_tokens`` (the
  #564-class check: our re-tokenization of the real model's real output
  against the real server's count). Zero tolerance per request on the mock
  rows; bounded-plus-majority-exact on the random rows, see below.
- for completions, client ``input_tokens`` == server ``prompt_tokens``,
  zero tolerance (both sides prepend special tokens; opt-125m's tokenizer
  adds a BOS, keeping #564-lineage special-token handling in play)

Client-side exactness cannot be zero-tolerance per request on the random
rows, because re-encoding generated text is not injective: the server
detokenizes its N generated tokens to text, and re-encoding that text can
merge adjacent tokens into one (measured against v0.26.0: greedy opt-125m
answers random-token prompts with e.g. ``'\\n' + '\\n'`` or ``'.' + 'I'``,
which re-encode as the single tokens ``'\\n\\n'`` / ``'.I'``; 1-8 of 40
outputs at budget 16 and 3-6 of 40 at budget 2 lose exactly one token this
way). Pinning a lucky seed does not help: the worker split varies run to
run, so a run draws from ~24 reachable prompts, and any vLLM release can
shift greedy numerics and re-roll them all. The invariants that do hold:

- merges only ever shorten, so ``output_len <= completion_tokens`` stays
  strict per request (a #564-class inflation bug still fails every entry)
- a merge costs one token and is rare, so ``output_len`` may fall at most
  ``MAX_REENCODE_SHORTFALL`` short, per request
- merge luck hits a minority of requests while a broken accounting path
  shifts every one, so at least ``min_exact`` of the 10 requests must
  round-trip exactly (a systematic off-by-one yields 0 exact and fails)

The token budget reaches the server by two different paths, and the table
covers both:

- mock rows: mock datagen sets no per-request ``max_tokens``, so the
  client-level default (``openai_client.py``) applies; these rows cover
  the completion/chat x stream/unary matrix. Their natural-text prompts
  have produced no re-encode merges across CI history, so they stay
  zero-tolerance per request and anchor client-side exactness.
- random rows: a fixed output distribution stamps an explicit
  ``max_tokens`` on every request, proving the configured budget survives
  datagen -> request body -> server, a path the mock rows never exercise.
  The 2-token row sits just above the single-token case that masked the
  pre-#410 accounting flaw, and runs unary only: real vLLM may coalesce a
  tiny response into one chunk, so the >=2-chunk structure invariant is
  only asserted for budgets comfortably above the coalescing scale.
  Random datagen is completion-only today; chat rows with explicit
  budgets become possible once random chat-template support (#693) lands.

CPU mode changes generation speed, not token accounting, so this runs on a
plain CI runner. See utils.vllm_server for provisioning; without a server
or a ``vllm`` executable the tests skip. The server is module-scoped, so
spawned mode pays one model load for the whole table rather than one per
row (external mode only re-runs the health check).
