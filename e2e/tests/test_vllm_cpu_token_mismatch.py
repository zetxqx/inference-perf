"""Client vs server token accounting against a real vLLM in CPU mode (#580).

The #410 mismatch detector only logged, so #564 stayed silent for months;
this test turns disagreement with a real server into a CI failure. Two
independent server-side ledgers must both agree with the client:

- in-band: per-request ``usage`` from the response, and the summary's
  ``token_count_mismatches`` (the detector's own output) must be zero
- out-of-band: the server's cumulative ``/metrics`` counters
  (``vllm:prompt_tokens_total`` / ``vllm:generation_tokens_total``) must
  grow by exactly the totals the client reports for the run

The /metrics deltas assume no other traffic reaches the server during the
run: fine for a spawned server, and for an external (shared) server only
when no other vLLM CPU test runs concurrently. The ``xdist_group`` mark on
these modules guarantees that under ``--dist loadgroup`` by pinning every
vLLM CPU test to a single worker.
